### 3.7 CodeCommit: Setup for new user

- HTTPs Git credential (use username & password)

- SSH connections (use public-private key pair)

  - Create public & private key pair on your local machine
  - Associate the public key with IAM user

- Use AWS credential (profile)

  1. Use `git-remote-commit` (recommended)
  2. Use `aws codecommit` `credential-helper`

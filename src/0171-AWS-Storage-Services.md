| Block        | Block storage is direct-attached to a compute instance with low-latency access.                                                    | Low-latency, high-performance durable storage for single EC2 instances or containers, e.g., databases and local instance storage                                                                                                             | Amazon EBS, Amazon EC2 instance store                                                                                                                           |
| File System  | File-based storage is natively mountable from virtually any operating system, and can be shared across multiple compute instances. | Shared read and write access across multiple EC2 instances/containers or from multiple on-prem servers, e.g., team file shares, enterprise applications, analytics workloads, and ML training                                                | Amazon EFS<br>Amazon FSx, Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, Amazon FSx for OpenZFS, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server<br>AWS Storage Gateway |

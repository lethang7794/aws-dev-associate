## Deployment strategy

### 3.2 Elastic Beanstalk Deployment policies

- Deployment policies (aka deployment methods/strategies):
  - AllAtOnce (Default)
  - Rolling
  - Rolling with additional batch
  - Immutable
  - Traffic splitting (aka Canary)
  - Blue-green (with `Swap environment URLs`)

### 3.6 CodeDeploy deployment type

[Overview of CodeDeploy deployment types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html#welcome-deployment-overview)
[CodeDeploy concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/primary-components.html#primary-components-deployment-type)

CodeDeploy can deploy application to 3 platform (called **deployment platform**):

- EC2/On-Premises <= Needs CodeDeploy agent
- ECS
- Lambda

CodeDeploy make the latest application _revision_ available on instance in a **deployment group** (a group of instances)

- In-place deployment: only support EC2/On-Premise
- Blue/green deployment

CodeDeploy supports 3 ways of routing traffic (via **deployment configuration**)

- All-at-once: 100%
- Canary: 2 increments: 10% + 90%
- Linear: n% x m times

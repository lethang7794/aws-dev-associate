CORS: Same Origin vs Cross Origin

> What is CORS?
>
> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):
>
> - an HTTP-header based mechanism that
>   - allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own
>   - from which a browser should permit loading resources.
>
> CORS also relies on a mechanism by which
>
> - browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource,
>
>   - in order to check that the server will permit the actual request.
>
>     ```
>     Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
>     Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type
